## Software Principals
This document is a rought draft. These are the principals of Executor that I've decided to write down:
- Sane defaults, I should be able to use the software with minimal setup and get started right away.
- All default UI components should be consistently created and fully customizable.
- You should be able to customize the UI components with minimal effort.
- The software UI should only show a "Loading" state when absolutely necessary.
- Use a server rendered first design whenever possible. Especially when the user refreshes the browser or something.
